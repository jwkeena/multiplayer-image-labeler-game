# multiplayer-image-labeler-game
A multiplayer game based on the original Google Image labeler concept, using GIFs via the GIPHY API instead. 

A full-stack multiplayer game that challenges users to use matching words when presented with a random GIF. To play, make sure both players have each opened the link or refreshed the page before entering their names.
This is because, as of now, the database refreshes on each page load.
